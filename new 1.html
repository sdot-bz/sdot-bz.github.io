    <h2>How Study Groups Became a Thing within IJC </h2>
    <p>Study groups began as a way for students to come together and share their knowledge. By collaborating and discussing material in groups, they could better understand complex topics, enhance critical thinking, and gain different perspectives.</p>
    <p>In a small school like ours, where everyone knows each other by name, study groups can be an especially powerful tool for learning. The smaller class sizes mean students have the chance to build deeper connections, and study groups can take that even further. When you’re studying with friends or classmates you see every day, it feels more like a shared journey than a chore. It’s not just about hitting the books—it's about working together, cheering each other on, and making the learning experience a little less daunting. This close-knit setting allows you to really get to know each other's strengths and help each other out in a meaningful way.</p>

	<div id="benefits" class="section">
    <h2>Benefits of Study Groups</h2>
    <p>Study groups offer numerous advantages, particularly in a small school where students share a tight-knit community. One of the best things about study groups at a small school is the variety of perspectives that each person brings. Because you’re working with the same group of classmates, you get to know how others think and approach problems. This helps in finding new ways to understand challenging topics and creates a supportive learning environment.</p>
    <p>In addition to academic benefits, study groups provide a space where students can reduce stress and lean on one another for support. Let’s face it: school can be stressful, especially when everyone is juggling multiple responsibilities in a small community. Study groups provide a space where you can share that stress, talk about what’s challenging you, and find solutions together. Knowing that you’re not the only one struggling with a certain topic can be a big relief.</p>

    <h2>Profiles</h2>
    <p>In our small study group, we find that everyone brings something unique to the table, making the learning process a lot more enriching. Whether it’s breaking down tough math problems, sharing a fresh perspective on history, or just offering some much-needed encouragement, every member plays a vital role in the group's success.</p>

				<p> Biography of a big Aspiration of mine: 
Bob Marley (1945–1981) was a Jamaican singer, songwriter, and cultural icon known for popularizing reggae music worldwide. Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, as Robert Nesta Marley, he blended reggae with elements of ska and rocksteady, creating a distinctive style that conveyed powerful messages of love, unity, and social justice.

Marley rose to international fame with hits like "No Woman, No Cry," "Redemption Song," "One Love," and "Buffalo Soldier." As the lead vocalist and songwriter for Bob Marley and the Wailers, he brought reggae into the global mainstream, making it synonymous with the struggles and aspirations of marginalized communities.

A devoted Rastafarian, Marley infused his music with spiritual and political themes, advocating for peace and equality. He passed away at 36 from cancer, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest musicians and humanitarians of all time.</p>
